This project is an EV Battery Safety Monitoring System designed to enhance battery safety by monitoring temperature, gas leaks, and fire hazards using multiple sensors. It provides real-time alerts through a buzzer in case of potential risks.


Features:

Temperature Monitoring with DHT11 sensor

Gas Leak Detection using MQ sensor

Fire Hazard Detection with IR flame sensor

Audible Alerts via a buzzer for immediate warning

Arduino Uno-based system for reliable performance


Installation & Usage:

1.Clone the repository

2.Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.

3.Connect the sensors and buzzer as per the wiring diagram.

4.Power on the system and monitor alerts.
